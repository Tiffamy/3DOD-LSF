# Improving Generalization Ability for 3D Object Detection by Learning Sparsity-invariant Features 


## Introduction


## Model Zoo

### General models


General models trained on Waymo dataset. The training Waymo data used in our work is version 1.0.

### Single-dataset Generalization



Results of single-dataset generalization on KITTI dataset with SECOND-IoU (moderate difficulty).
